      <aside>As a multifaceted gem of a person, Caroline has too many interests and hobbies to fit on a page. However, the main ones that she enjoys are shared here. Her favorite way to begin every day is by waking up absurdly early in order to spend an hour reading her latest book. She says it brightens her mood because she knows sheâ€™s already accomplished the best part of her day. After work you can find her settled on the couch with some type of drink that she has customized for herself and something to draw with, whether that means her iPad, journal, or sketchbook. Although sometimes she takes her drink to her desk and plays Sims to unwind. Other common things you can find her doing is planning and organizing her journal, reorganizing and redesigning her electronics, or creating packing lists for places she wants to visit. It may seem unbelievable but she swears she finds it relaxing.</aside>
