          <td>Caroline was born a joyful and creative bundle in Tucson, Arizona. She grew up with an older sister and a younger brother. Much of her childhood and teenage years were spent in dance classes and at dance competitions. And while she had a true talent that many of her teachers commented on, as she got older she knew that she didn’t want to put in the unending hours to become a professional dancer. During her senior year of high school she used her talent and knowledge to help the school’s new dance teacher (a P.E. teacher who had to take on the role unexpectedly) and when she graduated she decided to leave that part of her life behind in order to focus on other hobbies.</td>
          <td>Only a couple months after graduating she moved to Mexico where she lived for a year and a half and developed a love of the country and its people. When she returned home she moved to Idaho to begin college. She completed her first Disney College Program in the fall of 2018. The second time she applied she was accepted but then the program was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When restrictions were lifted she moved to Utah for a short time and then when Disney World opened the program again she was able to be a part of the first group they accepted. Instead of leaving Florida at the end of her program she chose to take a break from school and stay to enjoy all of the experiences the state had to offer. After two and a half years she decided to move back to Utah where she is now attending school while working and learning to be a dental assistant.</td>
