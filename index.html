She currently designs stickers, stamps, printouts, and other journaling supplies for fun in her spare time. However, in the future she would like to turn these fun hobbies into a full time job and successful business.
            </td>
            <td>Caroline was the first, and only, child in her family to graduate from traditional high school. After graduation she lived in Mexico for a year and a half where she learned the language and was able to immerse herself in the culture. Since then she has had the opportunity to live in four different states, enjoying the experiences that each one has to offer. She completed the Disney College Program, an internship program, twice for two different majors.

            <td>Caroline is currently going to school for digital marketing while simultaneously learning to be a dental assistant. She recently moved so her Etsy shop is closed. However, she is working on a collection in order to open it again in May.
            </td>
            <td> Many people have talents outside of their chosen focuses and Caroline is no exception to this. Family members talked of what a talented cook she is. She is always on time and is hands down the most organized person in her family. She likes to express herself not only through the art she creates but also through her clothes and is well known for her fun and eclectic fashion sense. She is an avid reader and is always looking for someone to talk to about the most recent book she read.
